Permissions on document_repository directory should be 777 in order to save uploaded files

/etc/php5/apache2/php.ini changes for large file uploads:

session.gc_maxlifetime 10800
max_input_time         10800
max_execution_time     10800
upload_max_filesize    1024M
post_max_size          1024M

Set your 'imagePath' and 'url' in the config file as the scripts use it

Insert .obj and .txt files in the 'files' table for an existing session

THIS IS A TEST
